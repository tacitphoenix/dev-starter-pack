# Programmer Starter Pack

Sweet so you want to learn how to program but where do you start? Getting a basic set

my attempt to give you the right tools to start your trip and add things your need at every
stop along your way. You may not have to use everything in this guide but knowing it
available will allow you to pick what you want to create your won style.
